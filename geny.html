				<h1>Generation Y: Title Sequence</h1>
				<p>Following a formative assessment on Generation Y, this brief required that I use industry-standard software, techniques and processes to create a title sequence for a fictional Netflix series: 'Generation Y' - A black comedy that chronicles the dreams and aspirations of twenty-year old twins and their rollercoaster ride to ‘successful living’.</p>
				<p>It had to demand the viewers’ attention, and set the tone for the program.</p>
				<p>The final title sequence had to be engaging, powerful, beautiful, clever and ultimately impossible to ignore.</p>
				<p>My concept revolved around the theme of Hedonism among Generation Y. My piece was unlike some obvious title sequences and instead of being linear, I designed it instead as a mood piece. I was aiming to get the themes of hedonism, death, and fraud out through music, imagery and overall mood rather than linear story-telling.</p>
				<p>Plot: Two 20 year old twins are having the time of their lives as they spend most of their time goofing around, filming and sharing on social media. They live out of home, by themselves when one of them dies. The other, afraid to tell anyone decides to carry on his social media profile and 'live' as his dead brother. He has to pretend as if nothing happened in order to keep his twins death a secret.</p>
