				<h1>Exchange Semester Portfolio</h1>
				<p>This brief was designed to increase my awareness of the fast-moving graphic design industry by demonstrating how Graphic Designers are often working on multiple projects at once. Throughout the semester we were expected to consistently follow real-life design studio practice, and respond to multiple tasks that have industry-real turnaround times and professional standard production requirements. As an assignment task this portfolio required great time management skills, an ability to prioritise my workload, and dedication as the projects within often overlapped with larger, more important core assignments.</p>
				<p>This portfolio specifically covered infographics, typography and layout.</p>

				<p>For this infographic task we were asked to visually analyse a particular set of data/facts and consider the best visual approach.</p>
				<p>The fact this infographic is based around is 'NBA's 10 Greatest Basketball Players of All Time' - or the best point scoring players of all time.</p>

				<p>This mini brief outlined that I was to produce an A3 typographic poster using a quote from a film. I chose to design around a quote from JK Rowling's Harry Potter series.</p>

				<p>The last example from the portfolio seen above was all about layout. We were required to re-design the BBC News website and aim it at a target audience of 18-35 year olds. In terms of the re-design, this was only a mockup, not a working web page.</p>
