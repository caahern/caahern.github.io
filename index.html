<!--   ABOUT PAGE   -->

<div class="container">

		<div class="offset-by-two columns eight columns">
			<p>I began my design career in 2013, and finding my passion in Graphic Design, I continued to study the field for the remainder of my high school years. In 2015 I followed this path into a Bachelor of Graphic Design at the University of Canberra, and will be graduating at the end of 2017 with an additional major in Web Design.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of 2016 I completed two weeks of work experience with Rowdy Digital (previously known as Goosebumps) in Canberra and among multiple university assignments, I have also designed for two real clients including but not limited to branding and business cards.</p>
			<p>One of the most influential experiences I have had to date includes a semester exchange to the University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. I lived and studied in the UK for a semester and had the opportunity to be taught, mentored and advised by renowned designers. This exchange helped me grow in a personal sense as well as enhancing my adaptability, decision making, independence and communication skills. This trip is an example of my perfectionism. I am constantly trying to perfect things in my life, including my work, and pushed myself far beyond my comfort zone for this exchange, reaching for both personal and design growth.</p> 
			<p>I have extensive enthusiasm for gaining experience and an intense willingness to learn. When it comes to design I have a particular passion in the field of Graphic Design and Web Design with additional hobbies including photography and illustration.</p>

				<h1>Corporate Gift Designs</h1>
				<p>The CBR Innovation Network is an initiative of the ACT Government, it is a unique collaboration between six world-class research and education institutes in the ACT who make up the foundation members: ANU, CSIRO, CIT, Data61, UC and UNSW Canberra. </p>
				<p>For this brief, The Innovation Network asked for two innovative, custom-designed corporate gifts. We were to design one high-end gift of no more than $100 per item in manufacturing costs and one smaller gift of no more than $20 in manufacturing. The corporate gifts need to be innovative and distinctive, and should have the option to be displayed. The gifts had to represent both the Canberra Innovation Network and Canberra as a city.</p>
				<p>For my high-end gift I designed a desk lamp inspired by one of the most iconic architectural buildings in Canberra.</p>
				<p>My smaller gift was a coffee table game of noughts and crosses</p>
				<p>This assignment required we make a functioning prototype and packaging for the gifts, to build both of mine I used mostly laser-cutting tools.</p>

				<h1>red corner</h1>
				<p>Red Corner Boxing (RCB) as a company has three core beliefs; reliability, empowerment through individuality and credibility with customers. Along with these core ideals, RCB has a distinct brand personality that is fashionable, inspirational, passionate, original, genuine, and most importantly a great fit.</p>
				<p>As the company evolves, the more focus they are putting on being innovative and forward thinking. With the aim to broaden the interest of boxing to women, their products intend to break down stereotypes around the sport by making boxing an acceptable fitness activity for both men and women. They have optimised their originality as a brand by selling products that are fun, exciting, empowering and customisable with a strong fashion appeal.</p>
				<p>They wish to continue this journey of innovation by building on their current range of products to suit a modern fitness consumer.</p>
				<p>This brief specifically asked for a new symbol design that incorporated a corner design element into it. The idea behind the symbol was for the company to be able to display it without needed the full logo, and for people to be able to recognise it. Similar to the way the Nike 'Tick' can be recognised as belonging to the complete brand.</p>
				<p>Along with the symbol design, the company asked for new designs for their Core series, and their Silver Label Series.</p>

				<h1>wayfinding</h1>
				<p>For this project I had to develop a solution to a wayfinding problem that I had identified.</p>
				<p>Problem: Queanbeyan is a small town located on the border of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It was founded in 1838 and today has over 37,991 occupants. Throughout the years there have been continual improvements in the town, however, as of today there is still no evidence of a clear wayfinding system. There is a mixture of old and new signage around the town but most consist purely for persons travelling via car.</p>
				<p>The existing pedestrian wayfinding system consists of handheld maps that can be found in the information centre located near the centre of town and a few scattered signs around town. As can been seen in the image to the right, the maps seen around town are not ‘people friendly’. They are small, hard to read and complicated especially for those who have trouble with maps in general.</p>

				<h1>Beauty and the Beast</h1>
				<p>For a Cross-Media unit I was assigned into a group assignment. The task at hand was to create a cross-media project based around a re-telling of a fictional story. As a group we chose to re-create and re-tell the story of Jeanne-Marie LePrince De Beaumont's Beauty and the Beast. We assigned each other different roles, my role in particular included designing a live website that would essentially leak different sections of the story regularly and leave clues to posters (designed and located around the university by a different group member). The website left clues to the missing pieces of the story through maps which showed the locations of the posters.</p>

				<h1>Black Lives Matter Website</h1>
				<p>On my semester exchange to the University of Hertfordshire I was given an assessment task focused on Web Design. This was different to any other web design task I had been given before, because we were limited to using Adobe Muse during production.</p>
				<p>The brief was to create an immersive online experience for the Black Lives Matter movement. It was required to not only produce an immersive experience, but to be professional, interesting, interactive, clever and beautifully designed.</p>
				<p>Although I struggled with Adobe Muse to begin with, I was quite happy with the end result with only a few changes I wanted to 	change using javascript or my own code if I had the chance. In saying this, there are a few minor glitches that I couldn't remove with the Muse program.</p>
				<p>It was also a chance for me to learn a new Adobe suite which is always useful in the long run.</p>

				<h1>Generation Y: Title Sequence</h1>
				<p>Following a formative assessment on Generation Y, this brief required that I use industry-standard software, techniques and processes to create a title sequence for a fictional Netflix series: 'Generation Y' - A black comedy that chronicles the dreams and aspirations of twenty-year old twins and their rollercoaster ride to ‘successful living’.</p>
				<p>It had to demand the viewers’ attention, and set the tone for the program.</p>
				<p>The final title sequence had to be engaging, powerful, beautiful, clever and ultimately impossible to ignore.</p>
				<p>My concept revolved around the theme of Hedonism among Generation Y. My piece was unlike some obvious title sequences and instead of being linear, I designed it instead as a mood piece. I was aiming to get the themes of hedonism, death, and fraud out through music, imagery and overall mood rather than linear story-telling.</p>
				<p>Plot: Two 20 year old twins are having the time of their lives as they spend most of their time goofing around, filming and sharing on social media. They live out of home, by themselves when one of them dies. The other, afraid to tell anyone decides to carry on his social media profile and 'live' as his dead brother. He has to pretend as if nothing happened in order to keep his twins death a secret.</p>

				<h1>Exchange Semester Portfolio</h1>
				<p>This brief was designed to increase my awareness of the fast-moving graphic design industry by demonstrating how Graphic Designers are often working on multiple projects at once. Throughout the semester we were expected to consistently follow real-life design studio practice, and respond to multiple tasks that have industry-real turnaround times and professional standard production requirements. As an assignment task this portfolio required great time management skills, an ability to prioritise my workload, and dedication as the projects within often overlapped with larger, more important core assignments.</p>

				<h1>Buddy: A Phone Application for University Students</h1>
				<p>The challenge in this brief was to help decrease the number of students who drop out of university in their first year. Using statistics from interviews and a number of both low and high quality prototype tests, we were to find the most common issues that many students find hard to cope with and hence suggest ways to address these issues using technology. We were to create a tool that engages students in their new learning environment and create a positive user experience.</p>
				<p>The Buddy app is designed as a virtual ‘buddy’ that can help and assist all university students with organisation, socialisation, and relevant resources. It’s the perfect friend because they’re always there and always know how to help. It has the ability to successfully guide students and relieve stress which is a significant achievement in relation to contributing to minimising the increasing rate of university drop outs.</p>

				<p>This project was to create a Tumblr website designed around a specific topic and audience of our own choosing.

				<p>My topic was all about dining out in Canberra. More specifically to unique, quirky, and urban restaurants or cafes in the area. I ordered, rated, photographed and discussed the dining experiences.</p>
